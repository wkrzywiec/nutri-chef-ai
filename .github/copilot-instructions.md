# Copilot Instructions for dietician-ai Repository

## Business Context
This repository is for a project that aims to build an AI-powered application to generate meal/course plans. The AI will propose dishes based on data stored in a postgres database. The solution will eventually include:
- An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server to interface with an LLM (Large Language Model) for generating meal plans
- A UI for user interaction
- Data storage - PostgreSQL

## Developer Profile
- The developer is a senior software engineer who values clean, maintainable, and modular code.
- Code should be easy to remove or refactor. Avoid tight coupling between modules.
- Code duplication is acceptable if it improves decoupling and maintainability.

## Applications

### UI

### Nutri Chef AI

### Meal Planner
